                                bank account and the right expense category.
                                </br>And at the end of the month or year , all you have to do is pick the right time period, click the right filters on the left, and tap the report button and you can find out exactly how much you spent on printer ink
                                for the business using Chase Bank, or exactly how much you spent on food that was a business expense and used your personal account.
